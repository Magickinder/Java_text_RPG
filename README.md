Hello, everyone!    
This is my first game in java.   
   
It's an simple RPG dungeon like game where you are going to dungeon, fight monsters, buy new equipment and fight 
monsters again until last dungeon with boss.

I'm making it mainly to learn basic of non objected programming. But after I'll finish it I want to make it one more time but
object oriented and maybe GUI.
